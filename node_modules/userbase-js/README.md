# Userbase: Create secure and private web apps using only static JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## What is Userbase?

Userbase is the easiest way to add user accounts and user data persistence to your static site. All Userbase features are accessible through a very simple [JavaScript SDK](https://userbase.com/docs/sdk/), directly from the browser. No backend necessary.

### Built-in user accounts
Userbase takes care of your user accounts. The Userbase SDK lets you sign up, login, and logout users directly from your static site.

### Zero-management database
Instead of sending database queries to a server, Userbase sends the user's data to the browser. Queries happen client-side, and there is nothing on the backend to manage or worry about.

### End-to-end encryption
Userbase encrypts all database operations in the browser with user-controlled keys. This helps you prevent personal data misuse, and lets you offer a high level of data privacy.

### Open source
Userbase is [100% open source](https://github.com/encrypted-dev/userbase), MIT licensed. You can host it yourself always under your control, or [we can run it for you](https://userbase.com/pricing/) for a full serverless experience.

## When would I use it?
If you're building a web app, you will likely need a database and a backend. Userbase can replace both of those things...

- If you want to build a web app without writing any backend code.
- If you want secure authentication out of the box.
- If you want to store user data securely.
- If you want to radically simplify your GDPR compliance.
- And if you want to keep things really simple.

## How do I start?
The easiest way to start using Userbase is to create a [free Admin account](https://userbase.com) and follow the [Quickstart](https://userbase.com/docs/quickstart/) guide. If you have any questions, or if there's anything we can do to help you with your web app, please [get in touch](https://userbase.com/contact/). Thank you!

## Browser Compatibility

We have tested support for the following browsers:

- Chrome >= 78
- Safari >= 11
- Firefox >= 71
- Chrome Android >= 80
- Safari iOS >= 13

To support Internet Explorer, you will need to use a Promise polyfill such as [this one](https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill).
